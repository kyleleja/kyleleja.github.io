       <h2>Will computing change society?</h2>
      
    <p> Let's start with the facts, in the period before computers were available to the populous, there was a tradition of privacy. The change in the past decade has been massive, anything put online has no real privacy, that anything online is one click away from being posted across the world. The digital age has many advantages, like being able to quickly access any information, but this in itself can be a major drawback. Everything you have ever done and will do stays there forever as your digital footprint. Encryption can never be foolproof, every code can be cracked, it just takes time. The way that the RIAA uses to find out who pirated content illegally is not very reliable, and many people have been wrongly accused of doing so. Comparing the digital age to the time before there is an obvious social change in the realms of privacy, accessibility, etc.

    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    
    <p>Well first off let's examine their similarities. Lightbot may look different on the outside, but internally it’s basically is a computer, be it a heavily simplified one, but one nonetheless. For example, Lightbot is in a set state, and different inputs, (actions), change that state in a variety of ways, like if it “moved forward” it would change position, and if it turned it would change its direction, and that new change becoming the new state. A computer does the same thing, it’s just infinitely more complex, like typing on keyboard changes different elements and these changes are incorporated into the new state. As for how Lightbot differs from a computer, the solution isn't as clear. For one there is the complexity difference, while Lightbot is restricted to certain inputs, like the move command, and specified outputs like turning or moving Lightbot. Computers aren't as restrictive, they have almost an infinite mix of inputs and outputs. These functions can even be adapted. Furthermore, normal computers can have artificial intelligence and can connect to a web of other computers that span the globe, while Lightbot is restricted to its resources, and doesn’t have A.I.
