    <h2>Will computing change society?</h2>
      
    <p> Let's start with the facts, in the period before computers were available to the populous, there was a tradition of privacy. The change in the past decade has been massive, anything put online has no real privacy, that anything online is one click away from being posted across the world. The digital age has many advantages, like being able to quickly access any information, but this in itself can be a major drawback. Everything you have ever done and will do stays there forever as your digital footprint. Encryption can never be foolproof, every code can be cracked, it just takes time. The way that the RIAA uses to find out who pirated content illegally is not very reliable, and many people have been wrongly accused of doing so. Comparing the digital age to the time before there is an obvious social change in the realms of privacy, accessibility, etc. </p>

    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    
    <p>Well first off let's examine their similarities. Lightbot may look different on the outside, but internally it’s basically is a computer, be it a heavily simplified one, but one nonetheless. For example, Lightbot is in a set state, and different inputs, (actions), change that state in a variety of ways, like if it “moved forward” it would change position, and if it turned it would change its direction, and that new change becoming the new state. A computer does the same thing, it’s just infinitely more complex, like typing on keyboard changes different elements and these changes are incorporated into the new state. As for how Lightbot differs from a computer, the solution isn't as clear. For one there is the complexity difference, while Lightbot is restricted to certain inputs, like the move command, and specified outputs like turning or moving Lightbot. Computers aren't as restrictive, they have almost an infinite mix of inputs and outputs. These functions can even be adapted. Furthermore, normal computers can have artificial intelligence and can connect to a web of other computers that span the globe, while Lightbot is restricted to its resources, and doesn’t have A.I.</p>

    <h3>1.1.3 Conclusion Questions</h3>
     
    <br>

    <p>1.	Why is it a good idea to write programs in small pieces and check how well they work after each piece is written?</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Because it is important to constantly check for errors, for example, you have just wrote 10 hours of code, and you finally run the program, low and behold it crashes. Now you must look through 10 hour a code to find the problem, like the saying it's better to have 1 hour of planning than 10 hours of recording. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2.	Professional programmers usually have to write a piece of a program several times before they get it right. Think of other tasks in life that require you to figure things out. How is programming similar or different?</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>I would attempt a confusing math problem a few times, and possibly try a hard video game level for a few as well, in both situations the goal is to find out what went wrong. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>3.	The introduction to this activity said, “Even the most complicated software or cell phone app is made out of very simple steps that happen one at a time.” That is not quite true. Each central processing unit core (CPU core) can process one instruction at a time. A quad-core computer processes four instructions at once. But any computer can run more programs “at once” than the number of processor cores it has. How do you think a dual-core computer, for instance, can make it look and feel like it is running ten or more programs at once?</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Because it might alternate between them, but due to it’s immense speed, we can’t make out the actions that the cpu is processing at one time </p>

    <h3>1.1.4 Conclusion Questions</h3>
    
    <br>
    
    <br>
                    
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172962273/">Objects and Methods</a>
            
    <p>1.Scratch broadcasts a message to all sprites. This is just how Scratch is set up as a programming language. We are using messages so that they are targeted to a particular sprite. In a large project with hundreds of sprites and scripts, explain why it might help to follow our convention that only one sprite will respond to a message and follow our naming convention for messages.</p>
            
    <br>
    
    <p>If you program one sprite with a response for multiple messages, it may become confused with the conflicting inputs, and its designated output may either get corrupted in some manner or not perform at all. Also, If you use logical names for your sprites, they will be easier to identify and work with than those without. </p>

    <br>

    <p>2. 	Based on what you learned during this activity, explain what you think events and handlers are.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>I believe that an event is an input sent to other sprites, and handler recognizes that input, and perform the coded action. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>3.	As computer programs get big and complicated, it is essential to manage the complexity. An important strategy for managing complexity is called encapsulation. With encapsulation, some details of one part of a program are hidden from other parts of the program. In cars, for example, the details of the accelerator pedal's actions are encapsulated under the hood. As the user of the accelerator pedal, the driver only gets to press the pedal and is not encouraged to tinker with the internal mechanisms that make the pedal do what the engineer intended.</p>

    <br>
    
    <p>a.	What are some details of the play() method that is encapsulated by the handler?</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>To find the sound file that matches the set parameters, load, and activate that file.  </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>b.	A software developer can make it easier for other developers to tinker with the details of the program she is writing by exposing the details. We'll get into what this means later. For now, just consider: What details mentioned in part a might be useful to expose? In other words, what variations on playG() do you think would be convenient to allow?</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>To “expose” the volume code, so that it may be adjusted to the user's preference, also the sound file parameters so that it may be configured to perform a different function. </p>
