    <h0.75> Let's start with the facts, in the period before computers were available to the populus, </h0.75>
    <br>
    <h0.75>there was a tradition of privacy. The change in the past decade has been massive, anything put </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>online has no real privacy, that anything online is one click away from being posted across the </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>world. The digital age has many advantages, like being able to quickly access any information, </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>but this in itself can be a major drawback. Everything you have ever done, and will do stays</h0.75>

    <h0.75>but this in itself can be a major drawback. Everything you have ever done, and will do stays </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>there forever as your digital footprint. Encryption can never be foolproof, every code can be </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>cracked, it just takes time. The way that the RIAA uses to find out who pirated content illegally is </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>not very reliable, and many people have been wrongly accused of doing so. Comparing the</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>digital age to the time before there is an obvious social change in the realms of privacy, </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>accessibility, etc. </h0.75>

    <h0.75>	Well first off let's examine their similarities. Lightbot may look different on the outside, but </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>internally it’s basically is a computer, be it a heavily simplified one, but one nonetheless. For </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>example, Lightbot is in a set state, and different inputs, (actions), change that state in a variety </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>of ways, like if it “moved forward” it would change position, and if it turned it would change its </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>direction, and that new change becoming the new state. A computer does the same thing, it’s </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>just infinitely more complex, like typing on keyboard changes different elements and these </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>changes are incorporated into the new state. As for how Lightbot differs from a computer, the </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>solution isn't as clear. For one there is the complexity difference, while Lightbot is restricted to</h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>certain inputs, like the move command, and specified outputs like turning or moving Lightbot. </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>Computers aren't as restrictive, they have almost an infinite mix of inputs and outputs. These </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>functions can even be adapted. Furthermore, normal computers can have artificial intelligence </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>and can connect to a web of other computers that span the globe, while Lightbot is restricted to </h0.75>
     <br>
    <h0.75>its resources, and doesn’t have A.I.</h0.75>
