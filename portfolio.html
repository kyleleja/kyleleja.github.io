    <h2>Will computing change society?</h2>
    
    <paragraphs>
       
    <p> Let's start with the facts, in the period before computers were available to the populous, there was a tradition of privacy. The change in the past decade has been massive, anything put online has no real privacy, that anything online is one click away from being posted across the world. The digital age has many advantages, like being able to quickly access any information, but this in itself can be a major drawback. Everything you have ever done and will do stays there forever as your digital footprint. Encryption can never be foolproof, every code can be cracked, it just takes time. The way that the RIAA uses to find out who pirated content illegally is not very reliable, and many people have been wrongly accused of doing so. Comparing the digital age to the time before there is an obvious social change in the realms of privacy, accessibility, etc. </p>

    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    
    <p>Well first off let's examine their similarities. Lightbot may look different on the outside, but internally it’s basically is a computer, be it a heavily simplified one, but one nonetheless. For example, Lightbot is in a set state, and different inputs, (actions), change that state in a variety of ways, like if it “moved forward” it would change position, and if it turned it would change its direction, and that new change becoming the new state. A computer does the same thing, it’s just infinitely more complex, like typing on keyboard changes different elements and these changes are incorporated into the new state. As for how Lightbot differs from a computer, the solution isn't as clear. For one there is the complexity difference, while Lightbot is restricted to certain inputs, like the move command, and specified outputs like turning or moving Lightbot. Computers aren't as restrictive, they have almost an infinite mix of inputs and outputs. These functions can even be adapted. Furthermore, normal computers can have artificial intelligence and can connect to a web of other computers that span the globe, while Lightbot is restricted to its resources, and doesn’t have A.I.</p>

    <p>1. Because it is important to constantly check for errors, for example, you have just wrote 10 hours of code, and you finally run the program, low and behold it crashes. Now you must look through 10 hour a code to find the problem, like the saying it's better to have 1 hour of planning than 10 hours of recording. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2. I would attempt a confusing math problem a few times, and possibly try a hard video game level for a few as well, in both situations the goal is to find out what went wrong. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>3. Because it might alternate between them, but due to it’s immense speed, we can’t make out the actions that the cpu is processing at one time </p>

    <p>1. If you program one sprite with a response for multiple messages, it may become confused with the conflicting inputs, and its designated output may either get corrupted in some manner or not perform at all. Also, If you use logical names for your sprites, they will be easier to identify and work with than those without. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2. I believe that an event is an input sent to other sprites, and handler recognizes that input, and perform the coded action. </p>
    
    <br>

    <p>a. To find the sound file that matches the set parameters, load, and activate that file.  </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>b. To “expose” the volume code, so that it may be adjusted to the user's preference, also the sound file parameters so that it may be configured to perform a different function. </p>

    <p>1.    If something needs to be changed down the road, you will find it easier to modify the (SPEED) variable for example, instead of manually changing every movement value in the code.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2.    Initialized, Value is used, unpredictability assigned. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>3.    (a) Any scorekeeping software, like Fifa 17, also in banking software to calculate the total.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p> (b) When money has been entered into the account the code adds the specified value to the accumulator, and this would have to have an accumulator code for it has a total value of the currency, and therefore must have been able to add that total value using an accumulator code. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>4. An accumulator function is to process a total value based upon given value, but an aggregator isn’t concerned with the total value, it merely wants when, how, etc. the value in question was added, and keeps a list of data. </p>

    <p>1.	A stepper is a code used to run through a set of instructions designed to “step” up in values to initiate a different code, a walker is a display of the specified values of the iterator, and a best so far is a value record for the highest or lowest value of a code. </p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2.	In a arcade game that has a point system, like the old video game called metal slug, their is a high score board at the end. This would require a best so far code that would take a value, and compare it to the old best value, and save it as the new best so far if it exceeds the former value.</p>

    <h2>Written Response</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>The program presented was written in Scratch. The purpose of the program is to get Mario to the next castle. My video demonstrates the basic movement of the Mario sprite, and the gravity system, shown when he automatically falls until he comes in contact with the ground or another sprite. The Mario sprite also has has top and bottom collison to other sprites, in addition there is a “game over” one way flag that is activated when the Mario sprite falls into a pit and this prevents all action after that point. </p>

    <h2>1.2.2 Conclusion Questions</h2>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>1.The App Inventor program is quite similar to Scratch in coding language, but instead of options about stationary computer, it has code blocks for mobile devices, such as mobile phones. Scratch doesn't show a bulk of the individual code’s and instead shows that in the source code.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>2.Pre-write- Many more people, new age, greater access, further advancement, cheaper cell phones? Possibly a better education in computing.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Official Draft- It will allow for many more people to be introduced to coding, and with that much resources involved computing it will greatly advance the industry.  </p>
